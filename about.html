                                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Photography has been my creative outlet for years. There's something magical about capturing a moment in time, whether it's the golden hour light filtering through leaves or the candid expressions of my four-legged coworkers.</p>
                                <p class="text-gray-700">You can follow our adventures on Instagram at <a href="https://instagram.com/ohrocketdogs" target="_blank" class="text-periwinkle hover:text-goldpeach transition-colors">@ohrocketdogs</a> where I share snapshots of our daily life and the occasional behind-the-scenes of my design work.</p>

                                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">My garden is my sanctuary. There's something therapeutic about getting your hands dirty and watching things grow. From succulents to seasonal flowers, each plant has its own story and personality.</p>
                                <p class="text-gray-700">It's not always perfect (those pesky squirrels!), but that's part of the charm. Gardening has taught me patience and the beauty of imperfection – lessons that often find their way into my design work.</p>

                                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">I'm a self-proclaimed bookworm, always with a stack of books waiting to be read. From design theory to fantasy novels, each book offers a new perspective and inspiration.</p>
                                <p class="text-gray-700">My husband and I often have reading dates – there's nothing better than cozying up with a good book and a cup of tea. He's my biggest supporter and the one who keeps me grounded when I get lost in my creative world.</p>

                                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Behind every creative person is a support system that keeps them going. My husband is my rock – he's the one who brings me coffee during late-night design sessions and reminds me to take breaks when I'm too focused.</p>
                                <p class="text-gray-700">And of course, there are our four-legged family members who make every day an adventure. They're not just pets; they're my daily dose of joy and inspiration. Each one has their own personality that adds color to our lives.</p>
